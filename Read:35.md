# Graphs


A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges

A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

There are many different types of graphs. This depends on how connected the graphs are to other node/vertices.

The three different types are :
  completed
  connected
  disconnected.

 

we  represent graphs through:

    Adjacency Matrix
    Adjacency List


examples of graphs in use:

    GPS and Mapping
    Driving Directions
    Social Networks
    Airline Traffic
    Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products
