# Read: 41 - Intent Filters

To allow other apps to start your activity in this way, you need to add an <intent-filter> element in your manifest file for the corresponding <activity> element.

When your app is installed on a device, the system identifies your intent filters and adds the information to an internal catalog of intents supported by all installed apps. When an app calls startActivity() or startActivityForResult(), with an implicit intent, the system finds which activity (or activities) can respond to the intent.

As your activity starts, call getIntent() to retrieve the Intent that started the activity. You can do so at any time during the lifecycle of the activity, but you should generally do so during early callbacks such as onCreate() or onStart().


Return a Result
If you want to return a result to the activity that invoked yours, simply call setResult() to specify the result code and result Intent. When your operation is done and the user should return to the original activity, call finish() to close (and destroy) your activity
